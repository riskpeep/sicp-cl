# SICP CL

The Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (SICP) otherwise known as the Wizard Book
perhaps because of the Wizard on the jacket.  SICP is used in introductory courses at MIT.
One of the bibles of the LISP/Scheme world. Also, less commonly, known as the Purple Book.

Information about the book and the corresponding courses may be found at http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/

In this repo, I'm working through the exercises using Common Lisp as a way to learn the language and see what all the SICP love is about.
