;Exercise 1.38:
;
;  In 1737, the Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler published a memoir De 
;  Fractionibus Continuis, which included a continued fraction expansion for
;  e - 2, where e is the base of the natural logarithms. In this fraction, the
;  Ni are all 1, and the Di are successively
;  1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 6, 1, 1, 8, : : :.
;
;  Write a program that uses your cont-frac procedure from Exercise 1.37 to 
;  approximate e, based on Eulerâ€™s expansion.
