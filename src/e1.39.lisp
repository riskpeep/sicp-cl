;Exercise 1.39:
;
;  A continued fraction representation of the tangent function was published in
;  1770 by the German mathematician J.H. Lambert:
;
;                  x
; tan x = -------------------,
;                    x²
;          1 - --------------
;                      x²
;               3 - ---------
;
;                    5 - ...
;
; where x is in radians. Define a procedure (tan-cf x k) that computes an 
; approximation to the tangent function based on Lambert’s formula. k 
; specifies the number of terms to compute, as in Exercise 1.37.
