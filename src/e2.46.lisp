;Exercise 2.46:
;
;  A two-dimensional vector v running from the origin to a point can be 
;  represented as a pair consisting of an x-coordinate and a y-coordinate. 
;  Implement a data abstraction for vectors by giving a constructor make-vect
;  and corresponding selectors xcor-vect and ycor-vect. In terms of your 
;  selectors and constructor, implement procedures add-vect, sub-vect, and 
;  scale-vect that perform the operations vector addition, vector subtraction,
;  and multiplying a vector by a scalar:
;
;  (x1, y1) + (x2, y2) = (x1 + x2, y1 + y2);
;  (x1, y1) - (x2, y2) = (x1 - x2, y1 - y2);
;        s * (x, y) = (sx, sy):
