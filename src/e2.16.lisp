;Exercise 2.16:
;
;  Explain, in general, why equivalent algebraic expressions may lead to 
;  different answers. Can you devise an interval-arithmetic package that does 
;  not have this shortcoming, or is this task impossible?
;
;  (Warning: This problem is very difficult.)

;; * - This problem veers pretty strongly away from the primary SICP topic and
;;     into number theory, however, it is a given problem so I've taken a shot
;;     at it here.  That said, while I gave this one the 'old college try,' I 
;;     must admit that I relied in part on others who helped me bring this to 
;;     a satisfactory completion.  My references included these sites:
